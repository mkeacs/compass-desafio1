# Challenge One Compass

This project consists of a simple posts blog where users can view a list of posts and click on a specific post to see its details. The posts are displayed in cards format with an image, title, and summary. When clicking on a post, its complete content and associated comments are shown.


## Features:

- Posts List: Upon opening the blog, users will see a list of posts, each represented by a card containing an image, title, and summary of the post. The list of posts is loaded from the data.ts data file.
- Post Details: When a user clicks on one of the posts, they will be redirected to the details page of that specific post. On this page, the full content of the post is displayed along with its title, and any comments related to the post.
- Comments: The comments related to each post are displayed on the post details page. The comments are loaded from the data.ts data file.
